# cutting_garden_plugin_file

The filesystem capture/restore backend for cutting-garden. Peer leaf
of `cutting_garden_plugins/` — not a nested subpackage. Registered
in init() under both the `""` (schemeless) and `"file"` URI schemes.

Owns the wire-format type-tag
`cutting_garden-capture_receipt-fs-v1`. The tag is locked per #16
and intentionally references the legacy "fs" segment rather than the
URI scheme name "file".

## What lives here

- `walkRoot` / `writeFileBlob` — capture-side filesystem walk.
- `materializeEntries` / `materializeFile` — restore-side write loop.
- `checkRootScope` — RFC 0003 §Producer Rules §Root Scoping.
- `assertDestinationDoesNotExist` — FDR 0001 §Preconditions.
- `validateEntries` / `pathConfinedTo` — RFC 0003 §Consumer Rules
  §Path Sanitization.
- `pathFromURL` — URL → filesystem path coercion (`url.go`).

These were extracted from `india/commands_cutting_garden/{capture,
restore}.go` when the plugin system was introduced; the receipt-blob
write itself (and its store-hint) still lives in the command because
it coordinates across roots that share a store group.
